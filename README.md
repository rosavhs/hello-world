general purpose repository: ideas, essays, articles, etc;
An old dog willing to learn new tricks;
I'm a CIO who started programming in the 80's with Basic, Fortran and Assembly for Z80 and Intel 80XX microprocessors;
I had a nice journey through avionics, tv broadcasting, industrial automation, marketing & sales, electricity regulatory offices until I got back to IT world;
Now I'm trying to get skilled in the PowerBI for my own consumption and company's users discussions, and, fortunately, to get an entry door for the data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence world.
